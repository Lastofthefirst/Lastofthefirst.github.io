# Portfolio Page

This is the portfolio page of Quddús George! It was built in pure html, css, and javascript, entirely handcoded. In order to display my ability to learn and employ new techniques I created this page using syntax and techniques I had no previous experience with in the span of two days.

## Getting Started

My portfolio page is hosted at https://lastofthefirst.github.io thanks to github pages! Follow the link to access the site containing this app.
