# Portfolio Page

This is the portfolio page of Quddús George! It was built in pure html, css, and javascript, entirely handcoded. Everything you see is of my own design, it started with a sketched concept art and a few short days later here it is.

## Getting Started

My portfolio page is hosted at https://lastofthefirst.github.io thanks to github pages! Follow the link to access the site containing this app.
